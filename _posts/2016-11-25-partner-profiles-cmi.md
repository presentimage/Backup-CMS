Crane Materials International, or CMI, manufactures innovative products which provide value added sustainable solutions for the construction and engineering communities.
<p class="col-10 col-push-1">The company has built their reputation on marine structures. Over twenty years ago, the vast number of compromised seawalls needing repair gave the founders an idea: create durable, long lasting marine structure materials. Since then CMI has grown and now ShoreGuard, Sheerscape, UltraComposite and AlumiGuard sheet piling is installed along thousands of miles of coastlines. These sheet pile products are commonly used in the following marine applications:</p>

<ul class="list">
	<li>Bulkheads</li>
	<li>Seawalls</li>
	<li>Tide Walls</li>
	<li>Breakwaters / Wave Breaks</li>
	<li>Jetties</li>
	<li>Groins</li>
	<li>Erosion Control / Scour Protection</li>
	<li>Retaining Walls</li>
</ul>
