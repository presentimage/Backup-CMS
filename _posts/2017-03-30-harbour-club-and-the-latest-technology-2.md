  CMS has made possible the construction
  of the Rodney Bay Dive Centre and
  Harbour Club Hotel by supplying and
  installing foundation piling, retaining
  walls and seawalls for the project. The
  property is built on soft, unstable
  land, originally reclaimed from salt
  marshand therefore required the latest
  foundation piling materials and
  techniques.
