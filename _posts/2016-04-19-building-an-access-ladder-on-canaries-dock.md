<p class="p2">On the west coast, the long needed ladder onto the Canaries Dock was completed in a few days at very short notice in order to allow vital boat access to the community for the Jounen Kweyol festivities. Due to damage from storm swell events over the years, all the access ladders and fendering that would have provided a safe landing stage for vessels when the dock was originally constructed, had been destroyed. The new ladder, was built quickly but solidly, restoring long term safe access for people and boats to this popular fishing village.</p>
