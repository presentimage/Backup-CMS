<h1 class="p1"><strong>CMS can provide dynamic and full scale static load testing</strong> for all kinds of piling according to ASTM D4945, D1143, D3689, D3966 or equivalents.</h1>
<h3 class="p1"><strong>Pile testing gives piece of mind to engineer and developer</strong> allowing designs to be physically verified and if necessary adapted according to the site conditions.</h3>

<p class="p1">We have developed portable testing drop hammers up to 2 tons and we have calibrated hydraulic rams and guages for static load testing up to 150 tons, that we use to apply load through a modular reaction beam system that can either be independently piled or can use production piles to provide the reaction load required - a far cheaper and quicker alternative to traditional methods such as the Kentledge load test.</p>
