<h1>CMS specializes in the installation of <strong>Ductile Iron Piles</strong></h1>
Also known as 'DIP', Ductile Iron Piles provide an economic solution for many building foundation, slope stabilization and bridge construction projects and can be dry driven or grouted<span class="s1">. </span>DIP solutions are particularly appropriate in the Caribbean <span class="s1">where some or all of the following conditions apply</span>:
<ul>
	<li>Conventional reinforced concrete or steel piles are not manufactured and have to be imported, incurring high cost of materials, freight, handling, taxes and duties.
<span style="color: #000000;"><em>By contrast, DIP are low cost, easily transported and handled, quick to install and have comparable load-bearing characteristics to conventional piles.</em></span></li>
	<li>There is low tolerance to the noise and vibration of conventional piling by drop-hammers, e.g. operating near hospitality areas, or close to sensitive machinery.
<span style="color: #000000;"><em>DIP installation is relatively quiet and generates minimal vibration.</em></span></li>
	<li>Sites have poor accessibility.
<span style="color: #000000;"><em>DIP are installed using the hydraulics of an excavator boom to drive the piling hammer, so piles can be installed anywhere an excavator can go.</em></span></li>
	<li>Sites have minimal facilities for material storage and handling.
<span style="color: #000000;"><em>DIP sections are shipped in 20 ft. containers and easily stored.</em></span></li>
</ul>
